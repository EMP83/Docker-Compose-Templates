If a host with problems needs to be removed, it can be found at this path:
<
/docker/nginxproxymanager/data/nginx/proxy_host
>

Theming:

The line below takes care of theming
<
- /docker/nginxproxymanager/themes/:/etc/cont-init.d
>

The path must be created in advance:
<
sudo mkdir -p /docker/nginxproxymanager/themes
>

Next we need to create the script that handles the themes:
<
sudo touch /docker/nginxproxymanager/themes/98-themepark-nginx-proxy-manager
>

Now we will edit our script to add the script content:
<
sudo nano /docker/nginxproxymanager/themes/98-themepark-nginx-proxy-manager
>

and add the contents of the 98-themepark-nginx-proxy-manager file from the Themes folder.
Save and exit.

The script must be made executable:
<
sudo chmod +x /docker/nginxproxymanager/themes/98-themepark-nginx-proxy-manager
>

Now Nginx Proxy Manager can be launched in Portainer or docker-compose.
