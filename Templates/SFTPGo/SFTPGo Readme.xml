First thing, the folder structure needs to be created:
<
mkdir -p /docker/sftpgo/backups
mkdir -p /docker/sftpgo/data
mkdir -p /docker/sftpgo/home
mkdir -p /docker/sftpgo/surveillance
>

The owner and permissions of the user running sftpgo in docker need to be set.
In my case the user is emp83:

The owner:
<
sudo chown emp83:emp83 /docker/sftpgo/*
>

Permissions:
<
sudo chmod 775 /docker/sftpgo/*
>


We only need this line if we intend to send files via sftp and we want them to be accessed with Samba.
<
mkdir -p /docker/sftpgo/surveillance
>

We don't need to create:
<
/docker/sftpgo/mysql
>
This will be created automatically.
