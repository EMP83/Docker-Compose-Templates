Fix for Memory overcommit from log

WARNING Memory overcommit must be enabled! Without it, 
a background save or replication may fail under low memory condition. B
eing disabled, it can also cause failures without low memory condition, 
see https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc/issues/1328. To fix this issue 
add 'vm.overcommit_memory = 1' to /etc/sysctl.conf and then reboot or run 
the command 'sysctl vm.overcommit_memory=1' for this to take effect.

On the host machine run:
<
sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf
>
and at the end add:
<
vm.overcommit_memory = 1
>
Save and reboot
