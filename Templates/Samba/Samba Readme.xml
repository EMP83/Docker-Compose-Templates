These are the basic steps that must be performed before installing samba in docker::


1) A group must be created to be used by multiple users in Samba:
<
sudo groupadd -g 1500 share
>

2) Users that will use samba need to be created if they are not already created.:
<
sudo adduser maxime

sudo usermod -aG sudo maxime # numai daca vreti ca acest user sa aibe drepturi de root in sistem
>

3) Users who will use samba will need to be added to this group:
<
sudo usermod -aG share emp83

sudo usermod -aG share maxime
>

4) The folders to be shared must be created:
<
sudo mkdir shares
sudo mkdir /shares/jellyfin
sudo mkdir /shares/plex
>

5) The owner and group of these folders must be changed.:
<
sudo chown -R emp83:share /shares/
>

6) The permissions of these folders need to be changed.:
<
sudo chmod 775 -R /shares/
>
