To be able to upload files after installation, 
the IP address must be set in the application, 
in the System Admin/Settings section

<
SERVICE_URL http://172.16.1.21:853
The URL of the server, like https://seafile.example.com or http://192.168.1.2:8000
>
and
<
FILE_SERVER_ROOT http://172.16.1.21:853/seafhttp
The internal URL for downloading/uploading files. 
Users will not be able to download/upload files if this is not set correctly. 
If you config Seafile behind Nginx/Apache, it should be SERVICE_URL/seafhttp, 
like https://seafile.example.com/seafhttp .
