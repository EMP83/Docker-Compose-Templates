The option to transcode in RAM is used to protect the SSD from too much wear and tear.
Today's SSDs are powerful enough that we don't need transcoding in RAM but if anyone, 
wants an extra measure of protection you can find it below.

3G represents the amount of RAM allocated to Plex to use during transcoding. 	  
Do not allocate more than half of the host's RAM.
